      <h3>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h3>
      <p>
        This project focuses on redesigning the website for No. 1 Boba Tea, a local boba
        tea store in Las Vegas. When first visiting <a href="https://www.no1bobatea.us/">their website</a>, I noticed that most of
        the parts were functional and that they are able to get their points across in
        presenting their menu, locations, and providing background about the store.
        However, upon further analysis, I was able to find a few areas for improvement,
        which mainly focus on making the site
        <b>more user friendly</b>, making elements <b>more intuitive</b>, and simplifying
        the structure so that information is more readable and
        <b>more logically grouped</b>.

        A few problems are described in more detail below and annotated in the screenshot:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (1) the menu for different sections is below a lot of other information, and you
          have to scroll up to reach the primary navigation bar
        </li>
        <li>(1) tons of menu options makes it overwhelming and cluttered</li>
        <li>
          (1) font size doesn’t really make sense: menu options are really tiny in
          comparison to the other site content
        </li>
        <li>
          (2) the colors of the buttons seem random and don’t have special meaning (green,
          white, red [may have unintended connotations towards the Italian flag], and blue
          on hover)
        </li>
        <li>
          (3) large section with no obvious and significant meaning (“the art of tea”)
        </li>
        <li>
          (4) gallery on first glance isn’t intuitive about switching images (no buttons
          or arrows)
          <ul>
            <li>
              hardly any obvious color contrast between currently active image and other
              images
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          (5) phone numbers and locations are all in one large clump so it’s hard to tell
          which phone number is with which location
        </li>
        <li>
          (5) “order now” is bolded, which suggests a clickable link that’s not there
        </li>
        <li>
          grouping and hierarchy doesn’t really make sense in a few places
          <ul>
            <li>
              (6) map icon links to one specific location that doesn’t match the main
              address on the webpage and is grouped with the other social media icons
            </li>
            <li>
              (6) two contact options are listed on the left, which overlaps with the
              social media links on the bottom
            </li>
            <li>
              (7) commendations and awards are on opposite ends of the page (one on the
              top and one on the bottom)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When analyzing the site’s accessibility, I found that in terms of visual styles,
        there weren’t any glaring concerns except for the fact that the contrast of the
        black text on red was pretty low. With the WebAIM WAVE tool, I noticed that
        although the website includes alt tags for their images, they aren’t always
        descriptive (ex: “Resized 4 OTS.jpg” for their logo). When using the screen
        reader, I found that there were 5 different elements to go through before reaching
        their main navigation and in the navigation bar, between “menu” and “pick and brew
        tea”, there were 9 sub elements of “menu” that we had to navigate through. As
        such, in my redesign, I want to prioritize being able to navigate directly to the
        main navigation bar and making descriptions more clear.

      <h3>Part 2: Visual Redesign</h3>
      <h5>Lo-fi Wireframes</h5>
      <p>
        Based on the usability problems identified in part 1, I first created some mockups
        for my redesign. I tried to focus on keeping as many of the original elements as
        possible while making the interface more intuitive with better hierarchy and less
        clutter. In these lo-fi wireframes of 3 different devices, I’ve annotated the
        sections that have been re-designed with the numbers associated with their
        identified problems in part 1.

        <img src="assets/lofi2.png" width="40%" />
        <img src="assets/lofi3.png" width="40%" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Below is some more detail about my decisions and how they address the previously
        identified problems:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In order to increase efficiency and usability, I moved the site’s navigation bar
          to the top. This allows a
          <b>more consistent theme</b> for the rest of the pages in the website as well
          because the navigation bar will always be at the top and there won’t be any
          other extra information above it. This mockup also keeps the navigation bar
          fixed at the top which makes it <b>easy to access</b> while browsing the site. I
          also renamed some of the sections and cut down the overall number, which makes
          the point of each section more clear and increases readability. In the mobile
          version, the menu is collapsed into a clickable button to prevent clutter and
          increase space efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the original website, the different colored buttons for ordering feels a bit
          overwhelming and has unintended connotations. In my wireframe, they were
          combined into a single “Order Online” button in the upper right, which makes the
          interface more standard and more learnable while still drawing attention to the
          option. Moving the order button here should also increase visual contrast and
          draw attention without using distracting colors. In the mobile version, this
          feature is inside the menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          While it was difficult to discern the meaning of this section in the original
          website, I decided to keep it and combine it with the “new drink” image to
          create a gallery. This creates a more centralized spot for announcements and
          banner advertisements. It’ll also allow the website to stay more consistent even
          if the images and content change, increasing memorability.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the original website, it’s difficult to tell what the images in the gallery
          are and how to navigate the gallery. In the redesign, I added arrows to promote
          more intuitive controls. The arrows are added on top of the image to minimize
          unnecessary white space, especially for the mobile and tablet versions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The original website lists all the locations and phone numbers in one long
          column, where the phone number is followed by the location. I grouped together
          each location with its phone number and added a bit of extra whitespace in
          between each location to create a grid that encourages better readability and
          keeps this section distinct from other information. I also took out the bold
          styling in “Call Us to Order” in order to prevent misinterpretations of a
          clickable link.
        </li>
        <li>
          Here, I ended up taking out the maps icon because it contained information
          repeated in the “Locations” section of the webpage. and didn’t want to direct
          people to one specific location. The icons were also changed to reflect a more
          updated and well-maintained interface. I also moved the Facebook and email
          sections here to group similar elements and create a hierarchy that emphasizes
          calling and ordering over emailing and social media.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, since I took out the “Reviews” section from the navigation bar, I
          combined it with the two comemndations and awards that the shop wanted to
          display. This way, similar information is grouped, which also makes it easier to
          process.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Responsive Redesign</h3>
      <p>
        When creating the responsive redesign of the boba store's website, I was really
        astonished by how much easier it was to use Bootstrap while making elements
        responsive. One thing I found out from trying navigate the site with the "tab" key
        to emulate screen readers was that it would include parts of my carousels like the
        controls and the indicators. Furthermore, in general, it didn't really seem like
        carousels were that friendly towards accessibility though it visually looks pretty
        good. When increasing font size, there's a slight margin where the sections of the
        nav bar become too big and causes the "Order Online" button to become two lines,
        but luckily for most other cases it collapses into the hamburger menu. Between my
        final product and my hi-fi prototypes, I found it difficult to customize some of
        the active effects that Bootstrap had so I ended up leaving them as is. Also, I
        realized that I designed my tablet protoype on a slighly bigger iPad Pro, instead
        of a regular tablet size, but luckily this wasn't too big of a problem because the
        menu could just be collapsed into the hamburger menu.
